## 🧠 Intro
Welcome to Lo-Fi! In this room, we’re going to get comfy with LFI (Local File Inclusion), a vulnerability that allows attackers to include files from the local server.

*Let's go for the room!*

<br>

> Want to know more about it? Check out the write-up on my vuln repo: [LFI]()

<br>

## 🔍 Recon
Talk about the first steps: visiting the site, running nmap, checking source code, etc.

Note any interesting findings here.

<br>

## 🔑 Access
Explain how you got initial access — logging in, finding creds, exploiting something, etc.

<br>

## 🧪 Exploitation
Detail the actual vulnerability. This could be an IDOR, SQLi, RCE, whatever. Include the thought process and what worked (and maybe what didn’t).

<br>

## 🏁 Flag
Once you found the flag, drop it here (or redact it if you're sharing publicly):

```
flag{go_get_it}
```

<br>

## 🎯 Takeaway
Wrap up with what you learned. Anything that surprised you or that you'll remember next time?
