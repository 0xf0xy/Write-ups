## 🧠 Intro
Welcome to **Neighbour**, where we’ll be exploring **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)**. This vulnerability occurs when an application trusts client-supplied data—like URL parameters—without properly verifying whether the user has permission to access the requested resource.  

*Deploy your machine and let's knock on our neighbor's door!* 🚪  

<br>

## 🎯 Task
To pwn this room, we need to:

- Capture the **flag**.

*So let’s see what we’re dealing with...* 🤔

<br>

## 🔍 Recon
After deploying the machine, we visit the IP in the browser:

> http://MACHINE_IP

![Neighbour_1](src/Neighbour_1.png)

We’re welcomed with a basic login page. Below the form there's a helpful tip:

> *"Don't have an account? Use the guest account!  
> (Ctrl+U)"*

So we hit `Ctrl+U` to peek at the HTML source and find this little gem:

```html
<!-- use guest:guest credentials until registration is fixed. "admin" user account is off limits!!!!! -->
```

Nice! Time to login.

<br>

## 🔑 Logging In
We log in with the credentials:

> Username: `guest`  
> Password: `guest`

Boom. We're redirected to:

> http://MACHINE_IP/profile.php?user=guest

And hey—the user parameter is sitting right there in the URL. Suspicious.

*Classic vulnerability vibes right here.* 😌

<br>

## 🧪 Exploitation (IDOR)
Let’s test if we can mess with that user value.

So we swap guest with admin:

> http://MACHINE_IP/profile.php?user=admin

![Neighbour_3](src/Neighbour_3.png)

And it works! We get access to the admin profile without needing admin creds. That’s classic IDOR in action.

*Never trust the user.* 😉

<br>

## 🏁 Got the Flag
On the admin profile page, we find our flag.

```
flag{go_get_it}
```

*Boom! Easy win.* 💥

<br>

## 📝 Notes
This room is a nice reminder that just hiding stuff isn’t security. Always make sure your app checks permissions server-side. Never trust users to only access what they should.
