## 🧠 About
This is a personal archive of TryHackMe room walkthroughs.  
Each write-up is crafted with a focus on the **mindset**, not just the tools.

Each write-up contains:

- 🖼️ Room banner + description  
- 🧩 Quick intro to the vuln + task 
- 🧭 Step-by-step walkthrough  
- 🎯 Flags captured  
- 🧠 Final thoughts

> All content is written with a chill tone.  
> Because CTF should be fun — not a compliance report.
